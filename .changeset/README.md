# Changesets

## Version Packages Together

Linked packages allow you to specify a group or groups of packages that should be versioned together.

Example:

```json
{
  "linked": [["pkg-a", "pkg-b"]]
}
```

## Access Public or Private

If this is a private repo, make sure to change `public` to `private`

```json
{
  "access": "private"
}
```

## General Info from Original README

This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.
